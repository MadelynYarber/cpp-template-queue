# Templated QuickQueue Class
A reusable queue structure implemented using C++ templates. The `QuickQueue<T>` class supports generic types and demonstrates dynamic memory allocation, deep copying, and class design.

---
## Features

- Template-based queue for any data type
- Enqueue and Dequeue operations
- Deep copy with custom assignment operator and copy constructor
- Dynamic resizing and pointer-based memory management
- Demonstration with `int` and `double` types in the driver program

---
## Built With

- **C++**
- Templates (`template<class T>`)
- Deep copying and memory safety
- Pointer arrays (`T**`)

---
## Learning Outcomes

- Templated class design
- Manual memory management
